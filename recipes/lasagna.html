    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>500g ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with half of the grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread a portion of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and a generous sprinkle of the remaining Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for 10 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil leaves and serve.</li>
    </ol>
